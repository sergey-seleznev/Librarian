The following task detail decisions were taken into consideration
during the engineering and development process:

- Things tend to change. So do the book Shelve configurations.
Now the library uses 20-book Shelves, but no one knows what will they use in a couple years.
So I decided to introduced a Shelf.Capacity integer field in advance.
It is used both in the database and user interfaces, having the current default number of 20.
The additional checks are used while positioning a Book, and editing a book Shelf with Books.

- The Shelves must all have unique numbers, but may use the same description.
The numbers are required for the administrators and users to be able to navigate efficiently.
However, the descriptions may be the same - in case of one Shelve grows to a number of them.

- Clients must have unique Names. A Client name is a simplified full name description all-at-once.

- Books should have unique combinations of Name and Title.
Imagine we live in a Singleton world, where all the books are printed only once.

- Books should have unique combinations of Shelf and Position.
One book fits a Shelf slot at one time.

- If a book is borrowed by a client, then this book can't be borrowed by anyone else until returned.
Since we have one copy of each Book, this seems correct.

- The user may manually clear a Client's untrustworthy flag.
Then the Client behaves as a trustworthy, until the next book overdue.

- Book borrowing return dates are recorder into the system database.
Currently this information is used for overdue analysis only.
However, in the future we may add extra Book & Client statistics reports.

- Overdue facts are also recorder in the Borrowing table.
This helps to save the information even in case the Book duration limit changes later.

- A Book can't be removed being borrowed by a client.
So it is required to close the Borrowing before the removal.
The system displays a corresponding error message in such a case.

- A Client can't be removed while it has non-returned borrowed books.
Otherwise the system displays a corresponding error message.

- A Shelf can't be removed while any of its Books is borrowed.

- When a Shelf is removed, all its non-borrowed Books are removed as well.

- On Client editing, his age must not be altered lower
than the currently borrowed books minimum age limit.

- On Book editing, its duration limit can not be set lower
than the current active borrowing duration length.

- On Book editing, its age limit must not be changed lower
than its current active borrowing Client age.
