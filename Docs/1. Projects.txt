Welcome!

The proposed task solution contains three .NET Core projects:

1) Librarian.Core (class library)
contains core task functionality, that can be used with any frontend.
The main entry point is LibrarianRepository class, that provides all the operations.
Furthermore, it features all the validation business logic.

2) Librarian.Web (web-host executable)
is a Web application host project, that contains a Web user interface.
It delegates all the operation requests to Librarian.Core engline library.

3) Librarian.Core.Tests project (test class library)
is the core task functionality's quality assurance pack, containing the unit-tests.
The tests are powered with xUnit, which integrates them directly into Visual Studio 2015.
Librarian.Core code is 100% covered, except the DB initialization autogenerated code.
In-memory data source is used for temporal data persistence during unit tests.
