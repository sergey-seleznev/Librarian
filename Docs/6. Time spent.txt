Time spent on the project:

- Task implementation:     9h
  By the reason of hard time limit, the development was
  started directly with the implementation, not the tests.

- Unit-test development:   9h
  A lot of time was spent for moving to FluentValidation engine.
  This allowed better unit-testing using In-Memory data source.

- Final verification:      2h

- Documentation writing:   4h

- Ubuntu publication:      2h

  Total:                  26h
